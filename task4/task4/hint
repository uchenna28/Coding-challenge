Stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities happen when unescaped input is displayed by the application after successful storage in persistence layers (e.g. database or cache). When HTML or script is included in the input that is stored in the database, and is then rendered into a page without escaping or encoding, it will be processed by a user's browser as HTML or script and can alter the appearance of the page or execute malicious scripts in their user context.
